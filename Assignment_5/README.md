# Python Basic Script Examples

This repository contains two basic Python scripts designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.

-   **`task_9.py`**: A script for looking up student marks from a dictionary using user input.
-   **`task_10.py`**: A script for slicing and reversing elements in a list.

## Task 9: Student Mark Lookup

This script demonstrates the use of a dictionary to store and retrieve key-value pairs. It initializes a collection of student marks, prompts the user for a student's name, and then displays the corresponding marks if the student exists in the records.

### Functionality

-   Defines a pre-populated dictionary `student_marks`.
-   Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
-   Validates if the entered name exists as a key in the dictionary.
-   Prints the student's marks if found; otherwise, prints a "Student not found" message.

### Source Code (`task_9.py`)

## Task 10: List Slicing and Reversal

This script illustrates list manipulation in Python, specifically slicing to extract a subset of elements and then reversing that subset.

### Functionality

-   Initializes a list of integers from 1 to 10.
-   Uses list slicing (`[:5]`) to extract the first five elements into a new list.
-   Uses extended slice syntax (`[::-1]`) to reverse the new list.
-   Prints the original list, the extracted sub-list, and the final reversed sub-list.
