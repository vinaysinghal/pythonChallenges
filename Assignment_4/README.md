# File Handling Python Scripts

This repository includes two simple Python scripts demonstrating basic file I/O operations.

---

## Task_7.py
- Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints each line from the file prepended with its line number.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if `sample.txt` is not found.

### Usage:
Run the script in an environment where `sample.txt` exists.

---

## Task_8.py
- Takes user input and writes it to a file named `Output.txt`.
- Appends additional user input to the same file.
- Reads and displays the entire contents of `Output.txt`.
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if the target file is not found during read/write operations.

### Usage:
Run the script and follow the prompts to input text.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

---

## Notes
- These scripts demonstrate basic file write, append, and read operations.
- Ensure appropriate file permissions for creating and modifying files in the script directory.
